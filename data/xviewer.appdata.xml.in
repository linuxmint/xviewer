      Xviewer is a GTK based, generic image viewer that can be used for multiple desktop environments.
      It is forked from Eye of GNOME. It supports many image formats for viewing single images or images in a collection.

      Xviewer also allows to view the images in a fullscreen slideshow mode
      or set an image as the desktop wallpaper.
      It reads the camera tags to automatically rotate your images in the correct
      portrait or landscape orientation.
